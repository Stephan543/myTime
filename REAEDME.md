# myTime Web Application
## What is the purpose of this?
This project will allow me to flex my fullstack dev muscles and practicing calling the google calender API. 

This project will automate the repetitive back and forth scheduling messages between clients, employers or anyone who wants to make some time to meet.

This solution will give me more:
1. Time
2. Energy - No longer need keep track of ongoing scheduling related conversations (1-2 days)
3. Effort - Allows me to be more flexible with rescheduling meetings 
4. Money - Opens up my schedule to short notice meetings

## What technologies will be used? (~ potentially)
* HTML/CSS/~Bootstrap/~Sass
* JS/~jQuery
* React
* Google Calender API

## Future Plans:

1. Once the minimal viable product (MVP) is running I will upload it to my server
2. Rigourous testing/ fixing bugs
3. Add in automatic reminders
4. Add in the ability to send meeting invites to my Gmail
5. Add in the functionality to reschedule meetings
6. Potentially add in a log in system for returning clients
7. Potentially add a credit card field depending on the type of meeting
